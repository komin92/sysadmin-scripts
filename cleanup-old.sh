# cleanup-old
# A utility script for removing old and unecessary files from secondary storage.
# Any files in the current directory or any subdirectories may be considered.
# Note: this is potentially a dangerous script, as it involves the deletion of files!
# 
# For every file that has not been modified for over 100 days, the user will be asked 
# if he/she wants to remove that file from the system. If he/she says no, then he/she
# will be given the option to ignore that file the next time this command is run.

# Prompts the user for a yes or no answer. If yes, this function returns 0 ("true").
# If no, this function returns 1 ("false"). This function will continue to prompt
# the user until it receives an answer of either yes or no.
#
# prompt is a string (likely a question) that will elicit the yes or no response
